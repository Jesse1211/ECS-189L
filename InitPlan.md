Initial Plan ([Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwWCpMwKJGOLQ-rRJt8G8zisCa2XHFhv6zSWars0eWM/edit#heading=h.i3tv2mxf7h7z))


## Core Concept

### Provide a synopsis for your game.

In approximately 150 words, describe the basic concept of your game. Provide a statement of purpose (i.e. a “hook”), basic narrative placement, and a description of the user experience for your game. 

### Describe the core gameplay system of your game. 

This section is important because it is directly related to your role as a gameplay programmer. In detail, describe the core gameplay system your game is designed around. Diagrams, charts, tables, and storyboards are all welcome. Your description sets the criteria for evaluating your project at the end of the quarter. This section should be the largest of this initial plan document.

### Explain your implementation plan to develop your core gameplay system?

Outline the classes, Unity entities (e.g. GameObjects, ScriptableObjects, and major components), scene hierarchy, and assets you plan to use in the development of your core gameplay system. 

### Why do you want to make this game? 

What is appealing to your team about this game? Why did you choose this idea out of all the possible ideas?

### Explain your game and the major systems it is composed of in terms of other games and genres.

This is the “related works” of your initial plan. What games are closely related to your game in terms of: aesthetics, systems, genre, etc.

### List your non-core gameplay systems and features.

## Scheduling

Provide a timeline for completing your project.
Have each team member break down their major tasks into speculative durations and start dates. Do the same for game-wide tasks. As this is an initial plan, its main goal is allowing your team to think through the steps of developing your game. A Gantt chart would serve you well. 

### How would your game be if everything went as planned?

### What would the results be if you lost significant time (e.g. you lost two weeks due to unforeseen circumstances)?

Graceful fall-back plans.

### If your progress is faster than expected, how would your game change?

Stretch goals.
